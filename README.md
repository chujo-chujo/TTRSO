## About

From the mists of prehistoric times, with its roots reaching back to the TTDPatch era, comes the legendary **Total Town Replacement Set**. And after two decades of replacing buildings in our towns and cities, it is now available as **an object set**.

Before I started creating this NewGRF, an important decision had to be made â€“ both the license of TTRS and Zimmlock as the main author allowed to 'adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the material', therefore two routes could have been taken, creative or conservative.

I chose to respect the original and convert the building set into objects as faithfully as possible.  Mainly, that meant multiple colour variants for many houses (even keeping some of the more 'cartoony' colours) and it also meant not changing ground/snow/grass tiles when they are drawn as a part of an original sprite; except for minor 'fixes' in places where old TTD basesets could collide with new ones.
If this style proves to be inconvenient or undesirable, it may be subject to future changes.

_Don't forget to check out parameters for additional options._

## Parameters

![Parameters.](/_readme/parameters.PNG)

* Only in Scenario Editor
   = Objects can be placed only when creating a scenario.
* Irremovable objects
   = Built objects (in the editor or otherwise) can be removed only by using Magic bulldozer.
 
* Hide airport objects
   = Disables the airport section of this object set.
* Hide infrastructure and construction objects
   = Disables the infrastructure and construction section of this object set.

* Use only the player's company colour to decorate buildings
   = Many buildings in this set have elements that are, by default, recoloured using a random company colour. By turning on this parameter, you can choose to use only the player's company colour.
* Use only one preset colour variant of buildings
   = Many buildings in this set come in several colour variants that are, by default, chosen randomly. By turning on this parameter, you can choose to use only one predefined colour variant.
   * [_The difference between these two options is sometimes arbitrary and depends only on the original author's choice of a recolour palette. That is why multi-coloured objects have a note indicating to which category they belong._]

* Select heliport graphics
   = TTRS offers 3 types of heliport graphics which can replace default heliports.
* Replace default truck stations
   = TTRS offers its own truck stations which can replace default graphics.
* Replace default bus stations
   = TTRS offers its own bus stations which can replace default graphics.
